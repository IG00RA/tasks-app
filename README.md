# Full Stack Project Overview

This project is a full-stack application utilizing modern technologies for both the front-end and back-end. Below is an overview of the technologies used:

### Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: Built using **React.js** with **Electron.js** for desktop application capabilities, and **Vite** for fast development and build processes.
- **Back-End**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Nest.js**, offering a robust, modular, and scalable architecture for handling API requests and business logic.
- **Database**: The application stores and manages data using **PostgreSQL**, a powerful, open-source relational database system.

### Features

- **Front-End**:

  - Dynamic user interface created with React.js.
  - Desktop application packaging with Electron.js.
  - Efficient development experience with Vite.

- **Back-End**:
  - REST API with Nest.js and Node.js.
  - PostgreSQL integration for data storage.
  - Modular and scalable architecture.

### Project Structure

The project is split into two main components:

- **Front-End**: The client-side of the application built with React.js and Electron.js.
- **Back-End**: The server-side application powered by Nest.js, handling business logic and database communication.
